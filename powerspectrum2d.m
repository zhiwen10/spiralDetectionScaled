function [sf nps] = powerspectrum2d(f, d, ns)
%% POWERSPECTRUM Get the normalized power spectrum of an image
%
%   [SF NPS] = powerspectrum(F) constructs the power spectrum of F by
%   averaging profiles of the power spectrum image centered at spatial 
%   frequency 0 mm^-1 and rotated by 1 degree increments. 
%
%   [SF NPS] = powerspectrum(F, D) takes as an additional parameter a two
%   element vector representing pixel size.
%
%   [SF NPS] = powerspectrum(F, D, NS) will do the above but take NS spatial
%   frequency samples.
%
%   Example:
%       f = imread('moon.tif');
%       [sf nps] = powerspectrum(f);
%       semilogy(sf, nps);
